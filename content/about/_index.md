title: About
---

My name is Doug Davis. I'm a software engineer at
[Anaconda](https://anaconda.com). Training to be a particle physicist
is where I learned I actually wanted to engineer software for a
living. If you're interested in Python, C++, Emacs, or data analysis
(with help from those tools), then you might find my posts useful or
interesting. Most of the software I write is on GitHub, where my
username is [douglasdavis](https://github.com/douglasdavis). I
(rarely) tweet [@Mx_ddavis](https://twitter.com/Mx_ddavis). You can
also reach me by email at `ddavis@<blogurl>`.
