I'm a graduate student and Ph.D. candidate in Experimental Elementary
Particle Physics at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). I'm
currently in my fourth year at Duke where I work in the ATLAS
group. My thesis analysis involves studying the production of some
elementary particles in proton-proton collisions at the [Large Hadron
Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider): a [top
quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark) in association with a
[W boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons). I also serve
as deputy coordinator in the transition radiation tracker (TRT)
software group.

My favorite parts of experimental particle physics are writing
software and analyzing data. My blog posts are (mostly) born from
technical things I encounter along the way to getting that Ph.D. I
care a lot about quality software, so I spend a lot of time not only
doing actual data analysis, but also writing software to _help_ in
performing analyses.
