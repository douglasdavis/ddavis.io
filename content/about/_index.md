I am a graduate student and Ph.D. candidate in Experimental Elementary
Particle Physics at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/) where I
work in the [ATLAS](http://atlas.cern/) group. My favorite parts of
experimental particle physics are writing software and analyzing
data. My blog posts are (mostly) born from technical things I'm
encountering during my graduate research in the field... and Emacs. I
care a lot about quality software, so I spend a lot of time not only
doing actual data analysis, but also writing software to _help_ in
performing analyses.

My thesis analysis involves studying the production of a couple of
elementary particles in proton-proton collisions at the [Large Hadron
Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider): a [top
quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark) in association with a
[W boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons). I have also
served as deputy coordinator in the transition radiation tracker (or
TRT, one of the ATLAS subdetectors which tracks the particles created
in the collisions) software group from September 2017 to September
2018.
