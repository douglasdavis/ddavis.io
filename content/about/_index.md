title: About
---

I'm Doug Davis, a Ph.D. student in Experimental Elementary Particle
Physics at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/). In the Physics
Department I work in the [ATLAS](https://atlas.cern/) group. Before
starting at Duke, I studied some neutrino physics at The University of
Texas at AustinðŸ¤˜. My favorite parts of experimental particle physics
are writing software and analyzing data. My blog posts are (mostly)
born from technical things I'm encountering during my graduate
research in the field... and Emacs. I care a lot about quality
software, so I spend a lot of time not only doing actual data
analysis, but also writing software to _help_ in performing analyses.

My thesis analysis involves studying the production of a couple of
elementary particles in proton-proton collisions at the [Large Hadron
Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider): a [top
quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark) in association with a
[W boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons). I also served
as deputy coordinator in the transition radiation tracker (TRT)
software group from September 2017 to September 2018. The TRT is one
of the ATLAS subdetectors which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracking_(particle_physics)">tracks
charged particles</a> and attempts to [identify their
type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_identification).
