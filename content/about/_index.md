I am a graduate student and Ph.D. candidate in Experimental Elementary
Particle Physics at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu/) where I
work in the [ATLAS](http://atlas.cern/) group. My thesis analysis
involves studying the production of a couple of elementary particles
in proton-proton collisions at the [Large Hadron
Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider): a [top
quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark) in association with a
[W boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons). I have also
served as deputy coordinator in the transition radiation tracker (or
TRT, one of the ATLAS subdetectors which tracks the particles created
in the collisions) software group from September 2017 to
September 2018. I still serve as the particle identification contact.

My favorite parts of experimental particle physics are writing
software and analyzing data. My blog posts are (mostly) born from
technical things I encounter along the way to getting that Ph.D. I
care a lot about quality software, so I spend a lot of time not only
doing actual data analysis, but also writing software to _help_ in
performing analyses.
