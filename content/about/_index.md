My name is Doug Davis. I'm a particle physicist by training (in the
closing months of my Ph.D. at Duke University), self taught software
engineer, and Emacs user. If you're interested in Python, C++, Emacs,
or analyzing data (with help from those three tools), then you might
find my posts interesting.
