It's been a while since I've made a new post... partially due to being
swamped with work and partially due to spending time (which _could_
have gone towards new posts) playing with
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I jumped in the Jekyll boat without really
investigating other options -- after learning about Hugo it seems to
be a better fit. I particularly like the dependency free, single
executable (happy to abandon the ruby bundler ecosystem). Now I have
some new motivation to post more - a new static website generator toy.

The transition was pretty painless. I polished up some mistakes in old
posts, made any changes needed for Hugo, found a theme on the Hugo
themes website that I liked, and started hacking away. Since I already
switched over to Netlify (see [this post]({{< ref
"/posts/2017-11-29-making-this-blog.md" >}})) it was very easy to have
their service build a Hugo website.
