After seeing many posts around the web describing the usefulness of
technical blogs, I decided it was time to start one. As I wrap up my
Ph.D., I'll write about different technical things I have to solve or
play with.

```emacs-lisp
(defun start-blog ()
  (message "here we go..."))

(start-blog)
```
