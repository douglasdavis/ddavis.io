Back in September, C++17 was [formally
approved](https://herbsutter.com/2017/09/06/c17-is-formally-approved/). C++
holds a special place in my heart and mind because it was my first
programming language and I still use it heavily today. If you've read
any of my other blog posts you've seen that the main workhorse of high
energy physics is C++. I was lucky enough to _really_ start using the
language when the 2011 standard was in the growing pain stage, and I
continue to try to keep up with the developments of the language and
the standard library.

With C++17's arrival, I wanted to talk about two things that I'm very
happy to see in C++17.
