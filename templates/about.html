    My name is Doug. Training to be a particle physicist helped me
    realize that I wanted to engineer software and work with data for
    a living. My first stop after academia
    was <a href="https://anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>, where I worked
    as an open source software engineer (in the PyData ecosystem) for
    nearly 3 years. I then joined Visa, where I'm currently working as
    an ML engineer productionalizing real-time model inference.
    (Nothing on this site represents my employer, past or present). My
    posts are mostly about software, data, or technical things I've
    encountered over the years. Some of the software I write is on
    GitHub (link to my profile above). I live in Austin, Texas, with my
    wife, Kristie, and our joyful little boy, Oliver. You can reach me
    by email: <code>ddavis@[this-site-domain]</code>.
