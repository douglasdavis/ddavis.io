    My name is Doug. Training to be a particle physicist helped me
    realize that I wanted to engineer software and work with data for
    a living. My first stop after academia
    was <a href="https://anaconda.com/">Anaconda</a>, where I worked
    as an open source software engineer (in the PyData ecosystem) for
    nearly 3 years. I then joined Visa, where I'm currently working as
    an ML engineer on a team that is building a real-time serving
    platform for fraud detection model inference. The content on this
    website includes only my views, no one else's. My posts are mostly
    about software, data, or technical things I've encountered over
    the years. Some of the software I write is on GitHub (link to my
    profile above). I live in Austin, Texas, with my wife, Kristie,
    and our joyful little boy, Oliver. You can reach me by
    email: <code>ddavis@[this-site-domain]</code>.
