## About

My favorite parts of experimental particle physics are writing
software and analyzing data. My blog posts are (mostly) born from
technical things I encounter along the way to getting that Ph.D. I
care a lot about quality software, so I spend a lot of time not only
doing actual data analysis, but also writing software to _help_ in
performing analyses.

I'm currently in my fourth year at Duke where I work in the ATLAS
group as deputy coordinator in the transition radiation tracker (TRT)
software group and as an analyzer in the single top working group.  My
thesis analysis will study the production of some elementary particles
in proton-proton collisions at the [Large Hadron
Collider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider): a [top
quark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_quark) in association with a
[W boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons).
